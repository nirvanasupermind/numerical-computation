# numerical-computation
A numerical analysis toolkit in Javascript, featuring derivatives, integration, matrices, tetration and more. It will be updated as and when new features are available. Below is a documentation of the installation process and all the current functions supported.

# Usage
To install, you can clone the file in a terminal using `git clone https://github.com/nirvanasupermind/numerical-computation/` or install it locally. 

Note that numerical uses require.js, so you need to use a `define` statement to import numerical:
```
define(["<file url>"], {
   var obj =  {
   func1: <func definition>,
    variable1: <variable definition>
   }        
           return obj
})
```

And if you are using an html file:
`numerical/
Where `<file url>` is the local file URL of numerical.js in your computer. For more info on require.js, check out their official site, and for info on Github installation, check out Github support.
